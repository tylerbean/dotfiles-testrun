# ~/.dotfiles

Explore the repo and incorporate what you like into your own setup. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or PR!

When you fork, remember to grep for `maximbaz` and replace with your username.

[Installation script](https://github.com/maximbaz/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh) is deploying an opinionated Arch Linux setup, but in general can be used by anyone. If you want to learn more, I highly recommend to at least read the installation script first, and maybe modify to your own needs.

If you want to try my entire setup in a VM, make sure to use `maximbaz` as the username - it will install additional things and my dotfiles.

For daily usage, I recommend forking [my repo](https://github.com/maximbaz/dotfiles) instead of using it directly, as I am changing things on daily basis ðŸ™‚

Enjoy! ðŸš€

## Fun things you can find in this repo:

â˜‘ A common color scheme for kakoune, terminal and Hyprland itself.

> It is called [Gruvbox dark](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).

â˜‘ Unobtrusive and minimalistic design of Hyprland, waybar and terminal.

> Display only actionable items, use color to highlight importance, slightly dim inactive windows.

â˜‘ True Color support everywhere.

> Including kitty, kakoune; terminal can even display picture previews.

â˜‘ Almost instant terminal startup.

> And yet it is empowered with antigen, prezto, powerlevel10k and other plugins.

â˜‘ More secure gpg and ssh configuration.

> Stronger algorithms, more sensible defaults.

â˜‘ gpg-agent configured to act as ssh-agent.

â˜‘ Hyprland automatically renames workspaces to show currently opened apps.

> Using iconic font to fit a lot of info even on laptop screens.

â˜‘ Automatically change terminal's background color based on the ssh host.

> Terminal turns red when you are on production, yellow on staging, etc.

â˜‘ Automatically adjust brightness level based on screen contents and amount of ambient light around.

> Useful for working at night, e.g. by dimming screen when switching from a dark terminal to a bright browser.

â˜‘ Automatically backup the list of installed packages (pacman and AUR).

> These files are used to bootstrap the new system, all apps are installed in one command.

â˜‘ Setup script that configures user and system dotfiles, systemd services and other little things.

> This script is safe to re-run at any time.

â˜‘ Arch Linux installation script.

> Fully automated script that installs Arch Linux from scratch and configures it exactly as I like.

â˜‘ btrfs snapshots for easy system recovery.

> Snapshots are automatically taken before and after each pacman transaction for easy system recovery.

## Usage:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/maximbaz/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ ~/.dotfiles/setup-system.sh
$ ~/.dotfiles/setup-user.sh
```

## System recovery

In case system doesn't boot:

1. Boot in a recent snapshot that works
1. Make it the default snapshot

   ```
   # cd /mnt/btrfs-root/
   # mv root root-bak
   # btrfs subvolume snapshot snapshots/NN/snapshot root
   ```

1. Reboot
